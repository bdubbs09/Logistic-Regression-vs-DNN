# Logistic-Regression-vs-DNN
Comparing the ability to use a DNN and logistic regression to classify spam.

Currently, there is an issue with the data set that I used in the script. I may have lost it or accidentally deleted it. I know that the entire project works however. Logistic regression is actually very close and often better to the results produced by the neural net model. This is interesting because it indicates that while a neural net can be extremely powerful, not everything requires it. Additionally, due to the complexity of a neural net and how difficult it can be to explain to a non technical person, logistic regression would be preferred. A neural net has its advantages on highly complex data, which this data set was not. There is also the issue of the training time. In this particular example, both are somewhat fast, but it is clear that the glm is much more efficient than the neural net while producing a better, more understandable process and result.
